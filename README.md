## Ubuntu Font Family for Android
This is a modified version of Ubuntu Regular True Type Font for Android Ecosystem. It is, as tested for 1 year (personal use), fully compatible with Android devices and does not misalign, misplace shown text. Currently, Latin symbols are 100% okay, Cryrilic was tested and did not seem to have any problem.

I used Roboto Regular font as the base. FontForge and FontCreator were the programs, I edited this font with.
